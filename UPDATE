1.  fetch github-wdas/master
2.  reset master from github-wdas master
3.  push master to origin/master (origin/master should be identical to github-wdas/master at this point)
4.  merge master into disney
5.  push disney to origin/disney (do this without creating code review branch:
    git push origin disney:disney)
